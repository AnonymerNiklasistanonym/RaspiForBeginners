# RaspiForBeginners

In this repository I'll wanted to document (now also with other cool people :raised_hands:) everything I do with my *new* Raspberry Pi 3 just for fun and education.

You can use this repository as a beginners tutorial for your own Raspberry Pi or probably learn something new and cool about it (or help us to make this tutorial/repository better :).

Have fun with your Raspberry Pi 3 :smiley:

# 0. Other cool things

Outside of the tutorial in this document you can find these things also on this repository:

* A funny and short introduction into Linux and Bash (only in German for now) from [denniskeller](https://github.com/denniskeller)
  ‚Üí find it in the directory `linuxdemo` (download it and click `index.html`)
* Some scripts in different languages if you want to get in touch with some programming languages
* Other things - if you have something cool just contribute it :D
  (or let me link your repository/website)

# 1. Get the hardware

**But first what do we need to have fun with our Raspberry Pi 3?**

* Obviously order a new Raspberry Pi 3 (I bought one from [Amazon for 36‚Ç¨](https://www.amazon.de/Raspberry-Pi-Prozessor-Quad-Core-cortex-a53/dp/B01CD5VC92/ref=sr_1_4?s=computers&ie=UTF8&qid=1501606913&sr=1-4&keywords=raspberry+pi+3))
* An at least an 8GB Micro SD Card (I've ordered a 32GB big one from [Amazon for 16‚Ç¨](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B013UDL5RU/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1))

**The following things you probably already have:**
*(you don't need them all for having fun but if you want to follow this tutorial)*

* USB Charger (5V 2A) with an Micro USB cable (or you can buy a specific power supply)
* HDMI cable
* Display with a HDMI port
* Keyboard (USB)
* Mouse (USB)
* A computer (I have a Windows 10 Desktop - other desktop OSs' should be fine too)


# 2. Setup an OS

Your Raspberry Pi is in front of you and you want to play with it... but therefore you need an operating system.
To install one you have many possibilities regarding the OS or rather Linux distribution ([See here the official guide](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/software-guide/quickstart/)).

**We installed Raspbian onto the Raspberry Pi:**

1. Therefore you need to download the current Raspbian distribution ("Jessie with desktop" did we download) directly from [raspberry.org](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/).
2. Then you extracted the ZIP file to get the image of the Linux distribution.
3. Because you can't just put an `.img` file on the Micro SD card you need to install a program like the open source program [etcher](https://etcher.io/).
   Simply install it, open it, choose the `.img` file, choose the correct drive and press flash.
4. Great, now you only need to safely eject the card and put it into your Raspberry Pi. :thumbsup:


# 3. First start
‚ÄãNow we are ready to go and can finally start the Pi. :muscle:

Because we (or better I) am not the best with the console I want to start in the graphical user interface of the OS. Therefore you need to follow these steps:

1. Connect the HDMI cable with your monitor.
2. If you want to use the system probably connect a mouse and keyboard via USB.
3. Now you can plugin the power supply or USB charger and connect it with the Micro USB port on the Raspberry to start it.
4. Enjoy the fresh desktop of Raspbian because you get automatically logged in and so straight to the desktop.


# 4. Security and network and more
## Security
You get automatically logged in as the user **pi** with the default password **raspberry**.

But because everyone knows that a default password isn't such a great idea you might wanna consider doing the following things:

### Change the default password

To change the fault password there are two ways:

#### Graphical User Interface

+ Click the raspberry icon at the top left
+ Click `Preferences`
+ Click `Raspberry Pi Configuration`
+ In the new window you are now in the tab `System`
+ There you click the top button `Change Password...`
+ Now you input the current password **raspberry** and below two times a new, *secure* and *long* password (like **IwouldLike666RaspberryPies:D**)

#### Console

The console is the most powerful tool - it's so mighty that we will do every step also in the console. It's in the beginning a bit strange, but thanks to a steep learning curve you will also soon like to work with it. :wink:

- Click the console icon at the top left (icon looks a bit like this: `>_`)
- Tada, you opened the mightiest tool and should be seeing something like this:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ‚ñÆ
```

This means you are the user **pi** and logged in at the computer with the name **raspberrypi**.

- now you can interact/talk with the OS/Linux distribution through typing in commands with your keyboard and pressing enter if your command stands there completely
- the first command we gonna use is the command `passwd` and press enter:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ passwd
Changing password for pi.
(current) UNIX password: ‚ñÆ
```

Now you input your old (or right now default) password (**raspberry**)
*(don't get frightened because you can see nothing - it's normal that if you input passwords the console only listens and not prints stars (*`*` *) or other things)*

- After you typed in the correct password you need to type in a new, *secure* and *long* password

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ passwd
Changing password for pi.
(current) UNIX password:
Enter new UNIX password: ‚ñÆ
```

- And after that type in this new password again

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ passwd
Changing password for pi.
(current) UNIX password:
Enter new UNIX password:
Retype new UNIX password: ‚ñÆ
```

- Nice job, you changed successfully the password of your Raspberry Pi over the console :smiley::thumbsup:

### Deactivate the auto login at boot

Normally every time you start the Pi you get logged in immediately without typing in your password which is .... cool I guess, but we (or at least me) want to be a bit more secure.

Because of that we want to change this so that every time you start the Pi you need to type in your credentials (through this way the possibility to forget your password is also minimized).

To change this we stay in the console or open it if it's closed and type in `sudo raspi-config`
*(`sudo` is an abbreviation of ‚Äú**super user do**‚Äù and allows Linux users to execute administrative programs that not every user should be able to run. Only the **root user** should be able to run them - for example not the guest user should be able to change these kind of things.)*

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo raspi-config‚ñÆ
```

After you pressed enter you will find yourself in the middle of the **Raspberry Pi Software Configuration Tool (raspi-config is the console name)**.

You now pilot the red selection with the arrow keys to
`3 Boot Options		Configure options for startup`.

Then you press enter and select
`B1 Desktop / CLI		Choose whether to boot into a des...`.

Then after you pressed enter you can choose what you want to boot in every time:

```
B1 Console              (boot OS in console only without GUI)
B2 Console Autologin    (boot OS in console and automatically be logged in)
B3 Desktop              (boot OS with a GUI)
B4 Desktop Autologin    (boot OS with a GUI and automatically be logged in)
```

We choose to always start with a GUI and without automatically be logged in.
So we select `B3` and press enter.

## Network
Because we also want to talk with the Raspberry Pi in our home network or even want to get access to the world wide web we not even need to connect a lame old LAN cable (üòú - but we can do this nonetheless if we want to or have no WLAN router).

Since the Raspberry Pi 3 has a cool WLAN chip, [and more if you want to know all the hardware parts](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/software-guide/components/raspberry-pi/), we can access the home network simply by clicking the WLAN symbol right next to the Bluetooth symbol at the top right. Then select the right network, click it, hopefully input a *long* and *safe* password and hurray! we  are connected to the home network and have internet (if you have internet in your home network ;).

## Resolution

Probably some of you have noticed that the desktop isn't full screen on some monitors like my 1920x1080 monitor. Let's change this so that we can fully enjoy the Raspberry Pi.

#### Graphical User Interface

- Click the raspberry icon at the top left
- Click `Preferences`
- Click `Raspberry Pi Configuration`
- In the new window you are now in the tab `System`
- There you click the button `Set Resolution...` and select your desired resolution
- Than you also disable Underscan and after one fast reboot you are fully prepared *"Es krachen zu lassen!"* (German idiom - literally translated to *"To let it crash!"* - right translated to *"To party hard!"*)

#### Console

The cool thing is - you can do the whole thing also in the console and you already know how! You don't believe me?

* Just open your console and start again the **Raspberry Pi Software Configuration Tool**  with the command `raspi-config`
* Then select `7 Advanced Options`
* Then select `A2 Overscan`
* Then select `No`

Same thing if you want to change the resolution:

- Select again `7 Advanced Options`
- Then select `A5 Resolution`
- Then select `Your desired resolution`

WOW. This was fast!
Now you have a small but cool computer that can do everything that your current computer can :)

(everything but being fast in Gaming, Web, Video ... ;)
(Note: It can even play 1080p and can be used for normal browsing)


# 5. Connect it

## Remote desktop connection

### XRDP (Works fine with Windows)

I wanted to access the device everywhere from my Windows Desktop and my Windows Laptop so I though a remote desktop connection would be a perfect start (I have also only one monitor so.... yeah).

This means that you can mirror the whole Raspberry Pi GUI on your Windows Device (or also Linux) and using it while the Raspberry only needs to be connected to the power and the same network like your Computer (LAN or WLAN - also the router needs to be allowing this and not isolate every device on the network).

I had some problems while establishing the connection with the tutorial from [Adam Riley on his blog](http://www.raspberrypiblog.com/2012/10/how-to-setup-remote-desktop-from.html), but thanks to this [stack exchange thread and Shreyas Murali](https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/56413/error-problem-connecting-to-raspberry-pi-3-with-xrdp/56415#56415) I could establish a remote desktop connection in... less than one minute:

* First input this to remove the somehow problem creating vncserver things
  `sudo apt-get remove xrdp vnc4server tightvncserver`
* Second install tightvncserver
  `sudo apt-get install tightvncserver`
* and last but not least install xrdp
  `sudo apt-get install xrdp`
* XRDP will automatically run after the installation.

One thing before we can start:
You need to know the IP address of your Raspberry Pi on your home network.

If you do not know the address we can use our mighty console by using the command `hostname -I`.
If you press enter you will see the IP address and mac address of your Raspberry Pi like `192.168.0.23 33ac:6589:a374:...`
just copy everything before the blank and you have the IP address or rather house number of your Pi in your network.

Now we can start on any Windows computer (over the program search) a *remote desktop connection*.

* You input in the opened window the IP address of your Raspberry Pi and click `connect`
* Than a strange window should open itself that asks for a username and password
* You type in as your username **pi** and as password your **your secure password**

Voil√†, there you have your Raspberry Pi desktop on your Windows computer.

### XRDP method for Android

You can even remotely control your Pi via your ANDROID device:

It's a bit messy, but here are the things you need to do:

1. Install a virtual keyboard, because the android app can't handle essential inputs like `-`.
   * `sudo apt-get update` - update the repositories
   * `sudo apt-get upgrade` - upgrade the whole system (optional)
   * `sudo apt-get install matchbox-keyboard` - install the virtual  matchbox-keyboard keyboard
   * `sudo reboot` - a reboot isn't really necessary but just do it quickly
2. You can now start it over the terminal with the command `matchbox-keyboard`
3. Download and install the android app [RDP Remote Desktop aFreeRDP](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.freerdp.afreerdp&hl=en) 
4. Set everything up
   * start the app and click the plus symbol in the top bar (*add*)
   * now enter under `Label` how you want to name the connection
   * for `Host` the IP address of the Pi
   * for `Credentials` click it and enter your username and password
   * now go to times back (press two times the back button) and save your changes
5. Enjoy your ANDROID remote control
   * click the new created connection and go straight to the desktop of your Pi on your ANDROID device
   * if you know want to execute commands just type in `match` + `Tab` and `enter` and you can input symbol's like `-` over the virtual console



Also because we set as automatic start of the Pi a GUI-start we now always login to the GUI of the Pi when we log ourselves in over a remote desktop connection without needing the raspberry connect to any cables but the power chord (and eventually your network cable if you do not have WLAN).

## SSH (terminal) connection

But what if we don't want a GUI. A simple CLI is enough isn't it?

Because of this here are some services, that let you connect to your Pi  so that you can interact with it via command line:

### JuiceSSH (Android - not Open Source - see next for Open Source)

First a mobile SSH client for Android devices:

1. Install the app via Play Store: [JuiceSSH](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sonelli.juicessh&hl=en)
2. Open it and click the first entry in the list: `Connections`
3. Click the plus at the bottom right (`+`) and 
   * Add a name for the connection under `Nickname:`
   * Enter your Pi's IP address under `Address:`
   * Click on the button right to `Identity:` (is named `New`)
     * Add now a nickname for yourself (`Nickname:`)
     * And your username (`Username:`)
     * And if you want add also your password under `Password:`
     * Now confirm the new identity by clicking the checkmark at the top right
   * Confirm again by clicking the checkmark at the top right
4. Now click the new entry in the list that was a second ago empty
5. Wait 2 seconds and ... *Woosh* ... You can now do everything with your Pi that you could do when you were controlling it over the GUI terminal

This is really amazing because you now am able to execute scripts or basically do everything you want as long at it has no GUI!!!!

:muscle:

### ConnectBot (Android Open Source)

Here a even simpler and Open Source solution that can do the same:

1. Install the app via Play Store: [ConnectBot](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.connectbot)

2. Open it and click the plus at the bottom right (`+`)

3. Click and expand the input filed `username@hostname:port`

   - Now input your username in the filed `username`
   - And input the IP address of your Pi
   - Enter a nickname in the field `Nickname`
   - Now conform your input by clicking the `+` at the top right

4. Click now the new entry in the list

5. A terminal will open itself and then a popup that asks if yo really want to connect - confirm

6. Then the terminal will say

   ````
   Attemting 'password' authentification
   ````

   and an input filed will popup right above your keyboard which will say `Password:`

7. Input the password for your username and click ENTER

8. Again wait roughly one or two seconds and *Wooooosh* you have full CLI control over your Pi over your Android device :launch: 

But this is not the only way to do this. There are many clients that can do this for many OS's. For example here a SSH CLI client for Windows:

### PuTTY

Also a very small but cool service for your Windows computer.

1. Install it over at [their website](http://www.putty.org/) (first link)

2. Open it and enter directly the IP address of your Pi
   (you are already in this but the input field is located under `Session > Host Name (or IP address)`)

3. If you not always want to retype the IP address enter in the input filed `Saved Sessions` a name for the connection and click `Save` after you are ready

4. Now click `Open` at the bottom of the window

5. Type in the terminal that opened itself your username:

   ```
   Login as: ‚ñØ
   ```

6. Input ENTER and now input the password of your account:

   ```
   Login as: pi
   pi@192.168.0.42's password: ‚ñØ
   ```

7. When you are ready press again ENTER and you are ready to rumble!

   ```
   Login as: pi
   pi@192.168.0.42's password: ‚ñØ

   Text

   More Text
   Last login: Tue Aug 15 00:24:18 2017 fro 192.168.0.21
   pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ‚ñØ
   ```

Tipp: You can enter full screen mode by clicking `Ctrl` + `Right mouse key` and exiting it like this any time (looks way more professional :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:) 

## File manager connection (SFTP over SSH)

The following services can you enable access to the file system of your Pi over the Secure Shell protocol:

### Filezilla (works on Windows)

Because of the Secure Shell protocol you can do even more cool things.

One of them is to remotely control the whole file system of your Raspberry Pi from for example your Windows computer over a program named FileZilla.

What do you need to do that you can do this?

First you need to activate SSH on your Raspberry Pi.

- over the GUI: `Preferences` >> `Raspberry Pi Configuration`
- or the CLI: `sudo raspi-config` >> `5 Interfacing Options` >> `P2 SSH` >> `Enable`

Now you can switch to your Windows computer and download/install FileZilla from [filezilla-project.org](https://filezilla-project.org/).

When you installed it launch it. 

- Then click in the upper left `File` >> `Site manager`
- Now create a new site with clicking the button `New Site`
- On the right click the tab `General`
- Now enter in the `Host:` text field the IP address of your Pi (`hostname -I`).
- Choose as `protocol` the Secure File Transfer Protocol (`SFTP`)
- The `Logon Type:` is `Normal`
- Now enter your Pi username (`pi`)
- and your **long, secure & unique password**

And you are ready to go. Just click `Connect` at the bottom left and you can see in the main window of FileZilla in the right file hierarchy the file system of your pi. Also you can copy, move, edit files from there.

[source](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/sftp.md)

### Swish (works on Windows)

If you want something more "native" under Windows you can use Swish, an native Windows SFTP client.

* Just download the client [here](http://www.swish-sftp.org/) and install it on your Windows computer. Nothing changed?
* Go to "my Device" in the Windows Explorer (there where you can see all your hard drives) and a new drive is there with the name "Swish"
* Now double click it and click at the top in the banner "Add SFTP Connection"
* Now input your desired name for the connection under `Lable:`
* Add under `Host:` your IP address and under `User:` your username and you are ready to create the connection
* Tipp: If you every time want to be directly in the home directory or in a specific directory enter your desired path under `Path:`
* Now after you created the connection double click the new icon and enter your password for the inputted user: Your file system of the pi natively in the Windows Explorer :raised_hands:

### Solid Explorer File Manager Beta (Android - Not free)

Because I used this feature way to often I want to add this although I think I paid something for the app (if you have working alternatives message me and I will add them :).

There are obviously countless SFTP Alternatives but here it is really simple:

*  Start the app, click the plus (`+`) at the bottom right
*  Click `New cloud connection`
*  Choose `SFTP` and click `Next` at the bottom right
*  Enter the IP address of your Pi under `Remote host name` and enter optional a specific path
*  Enter a name for the connection under `Display name`
*  Because I don't want to get into complicated things (I for myself couldn't do it) we only use the username and password for now (If you know how to do it more securely over a private key message me or add it yourself :)
*  Click `Next` and add your username and password
*  Click `Next` and again `Next` and check everything, then again `Next`
*  And then finally click the big, fat `Connect` button
*  If you now open the hamburger menu you can directly get into the file system of your Pi on any Android device :smiley:

# 6. Welcome to the console :)

## Introduction

The CLI (command line interface) is in contrast to the GUI (graphical user interface) solely text based.

This brings the advantage of printing out with very few commands small things like "Hello world!" to controlling and monitoring with some other commands a big server.

In addition, support is simpler due to the uniqueness of the commands.

If this is all Greek to you ("oder du verstehst bisher nur Banhof") just keep reading - it's really simple:

## Start the console

If you booted in the CLI environment without starting the GUI (see 4.) you obviously are already in the console. And if you booted into the desktop GUI environment you can click the terminal icon on the top bar to start the console.

But there is a third way (if you booted with a GUI):
You can press `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `t` to start the console everywhere without even touching the mouse.

If you now also want to go full screen just press `Alt` + `Space` and then `x`.

And if you want to close the terminal again just press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `q`.

## Shortcuts

Typing is is easy for you and with the arrow keys you already know how to get back and forth in the current command. So what can you possibly do better or faster you ask?... The answer is... a lot:

---

* `Ctrl` + `a` brings you in no-time to **the begin** of your current command
* `Ctrl` + `e` brings you in no-time to **the end** of your current command
* `Ctrl` + `x` + `x` moves your cursor between the begin and the end of your current command

---

- `Ctrl` + `b` move backward one character (same as `‚Üê`)
- `Ctrl` + `f` move forward one character (same as `‚Üí`)

---

* `Alt` + `b` move backward one word (or go to the start of the currently cursor pointed word)
* `Alt` + `f` move forward one word (or go to the end of the currently cursor pointed word)

---

* `Ctrl` + `k` *kills* or better deletes everything of the current command from the begin to the current cursor position
* `Ctrl` + `w` *kills* everything of the current command from the current cursor position to the end
* `Ctrl` + `u` *kills* everything of the current command after the position where your cursor is
* But all those shortcuts don't really kill or delete the text parts - they rather save them to a clipboard so that you can paste with the shortcut `Ctrl` + `y` these parts in your current command at your current cursor position

---

- `Ctrl` + `p` replaces your current command with your *previous* entered command (in entered history)
- `Ctrl` + `n` replaces your current command with your *next* entered command (in entered history)

---

- `Ctrl` + `c` stops/aborts the current running program in the console/terminal
- `Ctrl` + `d` stops every currently running program (closes the console in this case)
- `Ctrl` + `l` cleans the whole terminal

------

Also there is the holy grail the `Tab` key. It completes commands, filenames, etcetera...
If you press the `Tab` key again it will autocomplete to the next logical command, filename, etcetera...

## Commands

Here some simple but commands you should now or are helpful to know:

### Text output command ("Hello world")

---

#### `echo`

`echo` + ... or "..." ‚Üí output: ...

```tiki wiki
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ echo hello
hello
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ echo hello world!
hello world!
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ echo "hello world!"
hello world!
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ echo hello "world!" "what is happening?"
hello world! what is happening?hello "world!" "what is happening?"
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ‚ñÆ
```

You can even print a multiline text. Just let a simple `"` open and then enter line for line new text. If you are ready close it with typing a simple `"`. In between them you can just type enter and a new line will come up:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ echo hello "world! now press enter
> hello world! in a new line :o and now \"enter again\"
> wow again a new line... now we want to end by typing a " and pressing enter
hello world! now press enter
hello world! in a new line :o and now "enter again"
wow again a new line... now we want to end by typing a  and pressing enter
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ‚ñÆ
```

### File system commands

---

#### `ls`

stands for *List directory contents* and lists the current content of the folder you are in.

Wait a second - we are in a folder?

That's right. The console is always in a specific directory which enables many possibilities you will later learn about. With this command you can list the contents of the current directory your console *is*.

Folders are in the case of the default Pi terminal blue and files white.

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ls
Desktop Documents Downloads Music Pictures Public python_games Templates Videos
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ‚ñÆ
```

But there are more things like only commands on Linux:
There are also command options.

In the case of a directory listener you probably also want to know the size, date, and more:

`-l` ‚Üí long listing - get a list with size and date of creation and ...

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ls -l
total 36
drwxr-xr-x 2 pi pi 4096 Aug  1 14:59 Desktop
drwxr-xr-x 2 pi pi 4096 Aug  1 18:25 Documents
drwxr-xr-x 2 pi pi 4096 Aug  1 14:59 Downloads
drwxr-xr-x 2 pi pi 4096 Aug  1 14:59 Music
drwxr-xr-x 2 pi pi 4096 Aug  1 14:59 Pictures
drwxr-xr-x 2 pi pi 4096 Aug  1 14:59 Public
drwxr-xr-x 2 pi pi 4096 Jul  5 13:29 python_games
drwxr-xr-x 2 pi pi 4096 Aug  1 14:59 Templates
drwxr-xr-x 2 pi pi 4096 Aug  1 14:59 Videos
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ‚ñÆ
```

Explanation: ([used source](https://Linuxconfig.org/understanding-of-ls-command-with-a-long-listing-format-output-with-permission-bits))

* `d` stands for directory - `l` for a link - `c` for a character file
* `rwxr-xr-x` are the permissions applied to this *file* also called octets

  * the firs octet defines the permission for the file owner `rwx`
  * the second octet defines the permissions defined for the group `r-x`
  * the third and last part defines the permissions for everyone else `r-x`

    * The permissions are the following

       | `r`  | `w`   | `x`     |
       | ---- | ----- | ------- |
       | read | write | execute |

* `2` number of linked hard-links (links to that file/directory)
* `pi` the owner of the file/directory
* `pi` the group which this file/directory belongs to
* `4096` size of the file/directory
* `Aug  1 14:59` modification/creation date and time
* `Desktop` the file/directory name

`-a` ‚Üí shows not only the *normal* files, but also the *hidden* ones that start with a `.`
(because in Linux everything (file,folder,device,command) is a file, a file that starts with `a` is a hidden file)

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ls -a
.             .cache  Documents       .idlerc    .pki         .themes     .WolframEngine
..            .config Downloads       .local     .profile     .thumbnails .Xauthority
.bash_history .dbus   .gconf          .minecraft Public       Videos      .xsession-errors
.bash_logout  Desktop .gstreamer-0.10 Music      python_games .vnc        .xsession-errors.old
.bashrc       .dmrc   .gtkrc-2.0      Pictures   Templates    .Wofram
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ‚ñÆ
```

the cool thing with the command options are that you can just combine them in one simple command like:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ls -la
total 144
drwxr-xr-x 25 pi   pi   4096 Aug  4 14:46 .
drwxr-xr-x  3 root root 4096 Jul  5 12:41 ..
-rw-------  1 pi   pi   2162 Aug  4 01:26 .bashhistory
[too much unimportants code - I stop here]
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ‚ñÆ
```

---

Okay. So now we can find files in our current directory but can we probably also go into other directories?

Not a problem my friend:

#### `cd`

stands for *change directory* and will do the magic

You just type in `cd` and after that your path - the directory you wanna go. In this case we want straight to the documents folder:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ cd Documents
pi@raspberrypi:~/Documents $ ‚ñÆ
```

WOW. Did you just see that?
Wait a second, one more tip:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~/Documents $ cd ~
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ‚ñÆ
```

The thing after `username@hostname:` is the path where your console/terminal currently *is*. :open_mouth:

The odd `~` is the sign for your home directory. If you changed your directory so much, that you lost yourself just enter `cd ~` and you are back home.

But there are more tricks:

With `cd ..` you go one folder upwards

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ cd Desktop
pi@raspberrypi:~/Desktop $ cs ..
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ‚ñÆ
```

### Create/Edit/Delete/View files

Next we probably want to create files (that means folders and files):

------

#### `mkdir`

stands for *Make directory* and creates a directory with the name you write after it

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ mkdir cool_folder
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ls
cool_folder Desktop Documents Downloads Music Pictures Public python_games Templates Videos
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ mkdir cool_folder
mkdir: cannot create directory 'cool folder': File exists
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ mkdir Cool_folder
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ls
cool_folder Desktop   Downloads Pictures python_games Videos
Cool_folder Documents Music     Public   Templates
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ‚ñÆ
```

Three things:

1. Creating a directory/folder is simple and you did it :raised_hands:
2. If the directory already exists you get an error prompt
   (`mkdir: cannot create directory 'cool folder': File exists`)
3. If you come from a Windows computer you probably wondered why there was no error prompt after I created first the folder `cool folder` and then `Cool folder` without any kind of error prompt. That is because of Linux. The file system is in contrast to Windows - if you put it simply - not case sensitive. You can create files and folders with the same name as long as there is a difference in large or lower case. On Windows computers you can't do this. Every file in a directory there can only have a unique name.
4. Wait a second, I want also to create files :disappointed:...

------

#### `touch`

creates a file with the name you write after it :smiley:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ touch cool_file
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ls
cool_file   Cool_folder Documents Music    Public       Templates
cool_folder Desktop     Downloads Pictures python_games Videos
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ touch Cool_file
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ls
cool_file cool_folder Desktop   Downloads Pictures python_games Videos
Cool_file Cool_folder Documents Music     Public   Templates
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ‚ñÆ
```

---

**But attention:** If a file (this means a folder or a file) already is named `cool_file` and you enter `touch cool_file`. There will be no error prompt and there also won't be created anything. In such a case `touch` updates the timestamp of the file that is named `cool_file`.

---

After we now know how to create directories and files here an additional example for a longer path while using the command `cd`:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ mkdir Desktop/another_cool_directory
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ touch Desktop/another_cool_directory/hi
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ cd Desktop/another_cool_directory/
pi@raspberrypi:~Desktop/another_cool_directory $ ls
hi
pi@raspberrypi:~Desktop/another_cool_directory $ ‚ñÆ
```

Another additional tip:
If you - although the path is already in the console - want the whole path of the directory your currently at just enter `pwd`:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~Desktop/another_cool_directory $ pwd
/home/pi/Desktop/another_cool_directory
pi@raspberrypi:~Desktop/another_cool_directory $ ‚ñÆ
```

---

Two things to go: Deleting files and viewing/editing them

Of course you could install programs that can do these things so much better (for example an advanced text editor like Vim), but for now we'll use the `nano` terminal editor, because it is already installed.

---

#### `nano`

is a simple text editor

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ nano
```

If you enter this command in the terminal will start a new CLI where you can write text like in a normal text editor.. just you are still in the terminal.

When you are finished just use the shortcut `Ctrl` + `x`. Now (if you wrote something) the editor asks if it should save the things you wrote. If you press `y` you now just need to type in a name for your file.

The cool thing is you can not only do much more with `nano` and creating files, you can also really simple edit existing files:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ nano existing_file
```

This will open the existing file named existing_file and you can edit the content of it. Saving is the same just quit `nano` with `Ctrl` + `x` and press `y` now just don't change the name of the file and you edited successfully a file.

---

#### `cat`

enables you to quickly view the content of a text file directly in the editor

For example did I just edit the existing_file in my home directory like in the command before and wrote `Hello world!` . When you now input `cat existing_file` you will see the content directly in the console:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ cat exisiting_file
Hello world!
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ‚ñÆ
```

But how can you delete all these very unimportant files you created in the last 10 minutes?

---

#### `rm`

like *remove*

Doesn't sound so difficult, doesn't it? Let's clean my desktop:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~/Desktop $ ls
another_cool_directory exisiting_file hi tut tut.txt
pi@raspberrypi:~/Desktop $ rm hi
pi@raspberrypi:~/Desktop $ rm tut.txt
pi@raspberrypi:~/Desktop $ ls
another_cool_directory exisiting_file tut
pi@raspberrypi:~/Desktop $ ‚ñÆ
```

But if we try to remove a directory there is an error prompt... let's learn a new command:

---

#### `rmdir`

like *remove directory*

```
pi@raspberrypi:~/Desktop $ ls
another_cool_directory exisiting_file tut
pi@raspberrypi:~/Desktop $ rm another_cool_directory
rm: cannot remove 'another_cool_directory': Is a directory
pi@raspberrypi:~/Desktop $ rmdir another_cool_directory
rmdir: cannot remove 'another_cool_directory': Directory is not empty
pi@raspberrypi:~/Desktop $ ‚ñÆ
```

Okay. It seems like you only can delete empty directories. But of course we have a command for deleting also a not empty directory:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~/Desktop $ rm -r another_cool_directory
pi@raspberrypi:~/Desktop $ ls
exisiting_file tut
pi@raspberrypi:~/Desktop $ mkdir new_empty_directory
pi@raspberrypi:~/Desktop $ ls
exisiting_file new_empty_directory tut
pi@raspberrypi:~/Desktop $ rmdir new_empty_directory
pi@raspberrypi:~/Desktop $ ls
exisiting_file tut
pi@raspberrypi:~/Desktop $ ‚ñÆ
```

Damn. You're really fast. Some cool and helpful things before we go on with next steps:

### Find out more about commands

Another essential command is

------

#### `man`

like *manual*

Type this command and after it the command you want to know more about (be it what does it, what are the command options, etcetera...).

For example I want to know more about the command `ls`:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ man ls
```

Then in the console/terminal a manual which you can scroll through opens that contains all the information about the command `ls`. With pressing `q` you can leave the manual and are right back in the console/terminal. This works with every command.

### Command history tricks

---

#### `history`

shows all the executed commands (very long! - my example is small)

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ history
   1  echo hi
   2  echo hello world
   3  echo hello "world"
   4  ls
   5  ls -l
   6  ls -a
   7  ls -la
   8  history
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ‚ñÆ
```

(with the shortcut `Ctrl` + `r` you can search this history and when you think it's long enough type in `history -c` to clear it)

---

#### `!!`

runs the last executed command

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ echo hello world!
hello world!
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ !!
echo hello world!
hello world!
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ‚ñÆ
```

### Learn more commands and shortcuts

If you want to learn more shortcuts and commands (and believe us, there are so many) just search on the web. There are many sites (like our sources) that list cool commands and in the comments you will find more and more. The learning curve is very steep.

---

*Source of many shortcuts and many that we didn't told about: [skorks](https://www.skorks.com/2009/09/bash-shortcuts-for-maximum-productivity/)*
*Source of many commands and many that we didn't told about: [tecmint](https://www.tecmint.com/useful-Linux-commands-for-newbies/)*
*Even more commands: [raspberrypi.org](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/Linux/usage/commands.md)*

## Commands advanced

But there is even more that you can do with commands:

### Queue commands

If you don't get queue think of it like a command playlist. You could do for example this:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ cd Documents
pi@raspberrypi:~Documents $ mkdir Test
pi@raspberrypi:~Documents $ cd Test
pi@raspberrypi:~Documents/Test $ touch hi.txt
pi@raspberrypi:~Documents/Test $ cd ~
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ‚ñÆ
```

But this would require to input 4 commands and if you run programs you need to wait till one of the commands is ready and so on (like when you want to install many programs in a row).

Thanks to `&&` this is not a problem. Just put `&&` between the commands and exactly the same will happen without inputting each command after another, but with queuing them (or adding them to a playlist).

This will do the same as the last command line example:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ cd Documents && mkdir Test && cd Test && touch hi.txt && cd ~
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ‚ñÆ
```

You can do this with every command that exists. It's just a simple playlist/queue.

### Search CLI output

If you for example have a directory with 42 files and you enter the `ls -l` command you probably are pretty sure which file you are searching (or know something of the filename or know the file type).

To optimize the "long" search in such a case there is the command `grep`.

It's like a really simple regular expression text search that only displays lines in the CLI or files that contain a keyword you write after it. Input `ls -l | grep 'keyword'`

For a better understanding how `grep` works look at another example:

#### Search a text file

You are in this example a system admin at a cyber security organization and Alice forgot her password and asks you to give it to her. Because you have a text file with all the passwords of everyone in the form you have now the job to say her her password as fast as  possible:

File: `Documents/SecureFiles/nothingToSeeGoAway.txt`

```
Password for:
Jules: 123456
ObiLan: IhaveTheHighGround
Mona: securePassword
Nick: areyoufreakingkiddingme
Thomas: saveTheseDamnPasswordsAsHashesAdmins!!
Bernd: WhyAliceAlwaysForgetsHerPassword?
Alice: WhyDoIAlwaysForgetMyPassword????3897584
Bob: aliceIsCool
Jim: HiDwight
```

(Disclaimer: Never save passwords like this: THIS IS JUST A SIMPLE EXAMPLE FOR `grep`)

* You could now enter this:

  ```
  pi@raspberrypi:~ $ cat Documents/SecureFiles/nothingToSeeGoAway.txt
  ```

  and would get every line of the document. This would mean you would have to read every line...

* But if you instantly only want the lines that contain "Alice" you obviously would use `grep` like this:

  ```
  pi@raspberrypi:~ $ cat Documents/SecureFiles/nothingToSeeGoAway.txt | grep 'Alice'
  Bernd: WhyAliceAlwaysForgetsHerPassword?
  Alice: WhyDoIAlwaysForgetMyPassword????3897584
  pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ‚ñÆ
  ```

  You see: You now only got the lines which contain the text "Alice".
  Plus: Per default the terminal highlights it for you (if not use the option `--color`)

There are also obviously many command options (read the `man grep` page therefore), but one cool option is the addition of `i`. The normal `grep` command searches case sensitive, with the command `grep -i` this isn't the case (BaDummTsss) and you now get every line that contains in some way `Alice`:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ cat Documents/SecureFiles/nothingToSeeGoAway.txt | grep 'Alice'
Bernd: WhyAliceAlwaysForgetsHerPassword?
Alice: WhyDoIAlwaysForgetMyPassword????3897584
Bob: aliceIsCool
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ‚ñÆ
```

#### But there is even more besides `cat file | grep 'word'`

 ([Source of even more](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-use-grep-command-in-linux-unix/))

* Search for a word directly in a text file:

  ```
  grep 'word' filename
  ```

* Search for a word directly in many text files:

  ```
  grep 'word' file1 file2 file3
  ```

* Search the current output in the terminal of a command for a word:

  ```
  commandThatCreatesATextOutput | grep 'word'
  ```


# 7. Install additional software/programs

Installing programs is on Linux or rather on Raspbian quite different if you come from OSX or Windows.

Therefore here a quick and dirty explanation of operating systems and especially Linux:

## The operating system

### The kernel

The kernel is the core computer program. It has the full control over everything of the system and is the first thing that gets started on a computer start-up.

It handles all connected peripherals, input, output and thus controlling on what other programs having access to.

Systems like Windows and Linux have an underlying kernel.

Nevertheless there are big differences between especially these two besides that Linux is an open source developed and public viewable kernel and the Windows kernel is a cooperation secret.

### Linux distributions and Windows

Probably you know Linux distributions better under the names Arch Linux, Debian, Fedora, Gentoo, Manjaro, Mint, Ubuntu, Raspbian, etcetera.

These so named *distributions* don't have specific kernels. They all have the same kernel, the Linux kernel. \*

But only the kernel won't bring you far. Every system is only so useful as the programs that are installed on it. Like.. what would Windows be if you wouldn't have a GUI.

And because there are so many possible GUI's and file managers, file editors and network programs and even more programs that some people created distributions. They all consist of the Linux kernel and many chosen programs/packages.

You can think of Windows like the only distribution of the Windows kernel.

The cool thing about this on Linux distributions is that you can theoretically install every Linux program on every Linux distribution, this means also every GUI and so on.

\* there are ways to strip a kernel down in size but they are nevertheless all based on one Linux kernel

## How to install these... packages?!

It's quite simple how to install packages onto your Raspberry Pi running Raspbian:

Just type into the console `apt-get install` and enter to install the software:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo apt-get install <name of the software>
```

Why does this work?
Every distribution has it's own repository where they all saved these packages that work well with their systems. By typing this you can download it and get the newest for your distribution available package of the software you want.

### Example: Lets install Firefox

Normally on Windows you go to the Mozilla Firefox website go to the download page. Download the executable and run it. Then you wait till it's finished installing.

How's that on our Raspbian?

Funny thing I just found out: Firefox isn't listed in the console under it's real name (because it still supports flash which requires an *x86* processor but the raspberry pi has an 64 bit *ARM* processor) but under the name **Iceweasel**. So let's cut to the chase:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo apt-get install iceweasel
.... text
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ‚ñÆ
```

Okay.... did we install it now or what did we do?

If it only was easy to start Firefox now... Let's try something:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ iceweasel
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ‚ñÆ
```

Probably Firefox just launched and now you know it's installed.

### Example: Lets install cowsay

To install this very important package just type in:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo apt-get install cowsay
```

After the installation you can now use this command:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ cowsay Hi, I\'m a cow.
```

‚ÄãAnd enjoy the result. :smiley: :cow:

## What can I do when a new version of my installed software gets released?

That is also quite cool. Remember when I wrote that every distribution has it's own repository with all the  latest packages of every program you install over the package manager `apt`?

That's very handy because there is an command that compares all the versions and the kernel on your Raspberry Pi with the ones in the repository and updates the things that aren't latest on your Pi.

You therefore need to know two commands:

1. Update/Compare the local repositories with the latest repositories online

   ```
   pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo apt-get update
   ```

2. Download the new packages (if there are any new ones)

   ```
   pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo apt-get upgrade
   ```

When the command terminates all of your system software (kernel and over packages) should be the latest of your current distribution.

# 8. Program on it

## Bash

First let's create a bash script file:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ nano
```

Then we just write a simple bash script in `nano`:

```
#!/bin/bash
# A example Bash script file comment
echo WOW You just executed a Bash script :o
```

Then we save this by clicking `Ctrl` + `x` and `y` and entering the name `bash_test_script.sh` .

Now we can execute it:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ bash bash_test_script.sh
WOW You just executed a Bash script :o
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ‚ñÆ
```

## Python

First let's create a python script file:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ nano
```

Then we just write a simple python script in `nano`:

```python
print("WOW You just executed a Python script :o")
```

Then we save this by clicking `Ctrl` + `x` and `y` and entering the name `python_test_script.py` .

Now we can execute it:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ python_test_script.py
WOW You just executed a Python script :o
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ‚ñÆ
```

---

But when we speak about python we have even more possibilities on the Pi.

If you enter `python` in the console you enter a live python editor where you can program live:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ python
Python 2.7.9 (default, Sep 17 2016, 20:26:04)
[GCC 4.9.2] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more inforamtion.
>>> ‚ñÆ
```

Now we can do fun stuff in the terminal (everything we want to do):

```
>>> 2 + 40
42
>>> a = 2 + 6 * 7
>>> b = -2
>>> a + b
42
>>> ‚ñÆ
```

With typing `Ctrl` + `d` you can exit the python console in the terminal again.

---

You even have one more option - to program on the preinstalled python 3 console IDE.

To start it you can search and click the IDE icon **or**...

...we use the glorious mighty console:

````
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ idle3
````

Of course you can also open with this command directly any preexisting file like the one we just created:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ idle3 python_test_script.py
```

## C

First let's create a C script file:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ nano
```

Then we just write a simple C script in `nano`:

```c
#include<stdio.h>

main()
{
    printf("Hello world!\n");
}
```

Then we save this by clicking `Ctrl` + `x` and `y` and entering the name `c_test_script.c` .

But now there is a problem. C isn't a script language.
It needs to be compiled before it can be executed.

So let's compile it to a executable file: ([very interesting stack overflow answer to this problem](https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/a/5600))

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ gcc -Wall c_test_script.c -o executable_c_file
c_test_script.c:3:1: warning return type deafaults to ¬¥int¬¥ [Wreturn-type]
main()
 ^
c_test_script.c: In function ¬¥main¬¥:
c_test_script.c:6:1: warning: control reaches end of non-void function [Wreturn-type]
 }
 ^
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ‚ñÆ
```

We see all this (for now) not important comments/logs because through `-Wall` we enabled compiler warnings. This is really helpful for debugging a c program. `GCC` is the compiler that takes the code and converts it into an executable file. `-o` is needed to tell `GCC` to compile.

Now we can execute it:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ./executable_c_file
Hello world!
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ‚ñÆ
```

## Java

First let's create a Java file:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ nano
```

Then we just write a simple Java script in `nano`:

```java
/**
 * Hello World program
 */
public class java_test_script {

	/**
	 * Main method
	 */
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// A wild comment
		System.out.println("Hello world!");
	}

}
```

Then we save this by clicking `Ctrl` + `x` and `y` and entering the name `java_test_script.java` .

Now we have the same *problem* like C.
We first need to compile our code before we can execute it:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ javac java_test_script.java
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ‚ñÆ
```

This creates a executable file with the same name that we can now execute:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ java java_test_script
Hello world!
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ‚ñÆ
```

---

If you are more interested to learn Java I can't recommend you more Eclipse.
A great IDE to develop Java in and export it:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo apt-get install eclipse
```

Then wait some minutes, eat something healthy, do some sport and then finally

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ eclipse
```

Oh wait, wait again some minutes ... and then... you are in the eclipse IDE :smiley:

Now you can develop really cool Java code in a GUI that checks every action you take so the compile process will never print errors if you follow eclipse ;)

**Edit:** Probably you will notice very soon that it's very slow (at least the startup time - when it's running it's okay) - but you can use it on your Windows PC or Linux PC without these very long start times.

# 9. Set up a local webserver

## A *normal* webserver (Apache)

First we install Apache:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo apt-get install apache2 -y
```

By default there will be an instant *normal* web server created (on your local network).

You can get it anywhere on your local network by typing in your current IP address (`hostname -I`) or local also under `localhost` into the browser search bar.

If you probably also want to change the content of your local server just got to the directory `/var/www/html/` and edit for example the file `index.html` which will be displayed if someone enters the IP address of your Pi.

[source](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/web-server/apache.md)

For example:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo rm /var/www/html/index.html
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo touch /var/www/html/index.html
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo nano /var/www/html/index.html
```

Then edit in `nano` the file `index.html` to the content `Hello world!<br>This is HTML`.

After saving this you should instantly by searching for the IP address of the Pi see these words on the website.

### Enable SFTP in html directory (`chmod`)

If you use SFTP you probably noticed that FileZilla blocks uploads. With the following commands...

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ cd /var/www/
pi@raspberrypi:~/var/www $ chmod a+w html
pi@raspberrypi:~/var/www $ chmod a+w html/index.html
pi@raspberrypi:~/var/www $ ‚ñÆ
```

...you give everyone writing rights in this folder and now everything should work with FileZilla.

If you want to know more about `chmod ` look here: [source](http://www.dummies.com/computers/raspberry-pi/working-with-file-permissions-on-your-raspberry-pi/)

## PHP server

When we want to use PHP there isn't much more we need to do.

Let's start by installing PHP5 and the Apache PHP5 module via the package manager:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo apt-get install php5
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-php5 -y
```

Because we used the Apache module the same directory as before will be used. But now also `.php` files can be shared via local network.

[source](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/web-server/apache.md)

For example:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo rm /var/www/html/index.html
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo touch /var/www/html/index.php
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo nano /var/www/html/index.php
```

Then edit in `nano` the file to the content `<?php echo "hello world"; echo date('Y-m-d H:i:s'); ?>`.

***Didn't work - I probably need to set up the Pi again.***

## SFTP server

Now something that is mostly only interesting for you at home but really great:

You can use your Raspberry Pi as a home network media center or also as an drive on Windows. All thanks to SFTP.

Secure File Transfer Protocol is not only way more secure (because it works over SSH), way more performant and more advanced than FTP ([read this article for more detailed information](https://southrivertech.com/whats-difference-ftp-sftp-ftps/)), it's also really simple to work with when you want to setup a home network media center.

### Windows Drive

Sadly Windows itself doesn't natively SFTP - only FTP - but there is a really fast and simple workaround for that:

1. Download [Swish](http://www.swish-sftp.org/) and install it on your Windows computer.
2. Because nothing changed.. what the hell did you do?
3. Go to "This Pc" in Windows Explorer and see that there is a new Drive named Swish.
4. Click `Add SFTP Connection` and enter again your IP Address, Username, enter as path `/home/YOURUSERNAME` and give it a name/label
5. Now double click on the created connection icon and enter your password (for your YOUSERNAME)

Now you can delete files, add them, rename them and more natively over your Windows Explorer.

### Home network media center distribution (with Kodi as receiver)

But like we now want everywhere in the home network access to pictures, music and videos on our Raspberry Pi.

Nothing simpler than that thanks to Kodi. Kodi is an Open Source Media Center application that we will use because it is fast, Open Source, supports seamless SFTP and exists for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.xbmc.kodi&hl=en), [Windows (App store)](https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/store/p/kodi/9nblggh4t892), Linux distributions, [etcetera](https://kodi.tv/download).

1. Install it on the device of your choice and start Kodi. (I did install it on my Android phone (6.0) and on my Amazon Fire TV stick). 
2. Then, because you probably don't have any sources at the begin you will get asked `Enter file section`. 
3. Now you click `Add videos` or `Add Music` or something else depending on where you clicked.
   (If nowhere you can read this, but you read `Files` click this)
4. A popup window will open itself and ask if you want to add any sources (for example `Add video source`.
5. Click browse to get into another popup window. There you want to click the list entry `Add network location`.
6. Because you want to connect to the Pi with the fast, secure and reliable SFTP protocol we change the protocol to `Secure Shell (SSH / SFTP)`
7. Now do the same thing you did so far every SFTP Setup and enter your Pi's IP address (@`Server address`, you username (@`Username`), your password (@`Password`) and click `OK`.
8. You will now get back to the list where you can browse through connected sources (`Browse for new share`) and can now simply click the `sftp://YOURIPADDRESS:22` and browse to your folder that you want to add to this category (`home/YOURUSERNAME/Music` for example) and confirm the location.
9. Now Kodi will need some time to search through all your files, but when it's ready you can stream music, video, image, and more files seamless from your Pi to Kodi on every supported OS that is connected to your home network.

You can even add more things and do even more cool things with Kodi but this is not a Kodi tutorial - just how you can use this Open Source software to get a simple and secure, but also great home network media center.

DISCLAIMER:
To get this working  you first need a fast home network connection (at my place over old telephone lines and two routers and then over 5Ghz Wi-Fi to the Amazon Fire TV Stick I have around 80mbps). And because even the Pi has it's limits you need to accept that it cannot deliver many files to many users at the same time and also not big files to one person at a time.
For me music, video and picture streaming was no problem, but a 4K video file of the Blender demo video "Tears of Steel" @6,27 GB could not be streamed (which was the case because of a mix of the *bad* home network bandwidth - but the main reason was I think the rather *slow* Pi). As long as you are in my range of hardware 1080p videos shouldn't be a problem for you and music/picture streaming should work great too.


# 10. Automated tasks scheduler (`cron `)

https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/usage/cron.md

Cron jobs are a really cool thing that you can use as Linux user.

Over the cron scheduler you can program to run script at a time you want every week/year/minute/hour/etcetera. And it's so easy to use on Raspbian because there is even a GUI version of it preinstalled.

## Create a script for a `cron` job

You can at this point create whatever you want. Because this is a demo tutorial I will not setup a connection to a Mail API or something other, but the possibilities are endless.

We will just make a simple python script that creates a log entry every time the script runs - a simple demo of the mighty cron scheduler:

```python
import os
import datetime

# this get's us the path of the PI's home directory
# this is important, because every cron job script will be
# run from the home directory - even when it's not there
PATH_HOME_DIR = os.path.expanduser('~')

# Directory where we want to create the log
PATH_FILE_DIR = os.path.join(PATH_HOME_DIR, 'Documents/CronDemoLog')

# Path of the log file
PATH_FILE = os.path.join(PATH_FILE_DIR, 'log.txt')

# Check if the directory exists, if not create it
if not os.path.exists(PATH_FILE_DIR):
    os.makedirs(PATH_FILE_DIR)

# get the current time
date_time = datetime.datetime.now()

date = date_time.date()  # gives date
time = date_time.time()  # gives time

date_string = str(date.year) + "-" + str(date.month) + "-" + str(date.day)
time_string = str(time.hour) + ":" + str(time.minute) + ":" + str(time.second)

# create a file and add the current time or if it exists just add the current time
file = open(PATH_FILE, "a+")
file.write("The script was executed at " + time_string + " on " + date_string)
file.write("\n") # write newline
file.close()

# read file to the console (https://stackoverflow.com/a/43625375/7827128)
with open(PATH_FILE) as file:
     my_list = file.readlines()
my_list = [x.strip() for x in my_list]
for rows in my_list:
    print(rows)
```

Every time this python script runs it will add an entry of the current time to the text file `home/USERNAME/Documents/Documents/CronDemoLog/log.txt`.

With this you can check if the cron scheduler works or not.

So let's copy it somewhere on the Pi (I copied it to `home/USERNAME/script.py`) and run it with the console:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ python script.py
This script was executed at 14:7:0 on 2017-8-10
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ‚ñÆ
```

Your output should get one line more every time you enter this command:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ python script.py
This script was executed at 14:7:0 on 2017-8-10
This script was executed at 14:8:8 on 2017-8-10
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ‚ñÆ
```

You can also always read the file by using `cat`:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ cat Documents/CronDemoLog/log.txt
This script was executed at 14:7:0 on 2017-8-10
This script was executed at 14:8:8 on 2017-8-10
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ‚ñÆ
```

## Create a `cron` job

Now we are ready to create our first `cron` job. Therefore we start the GUI with the command:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ gnome-schedule 
```

If this doesn't work install the GUI with this command:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gnome-schedule  
```

* Now that we opened the GUI click `New` at the top left
* and in the popup window `A task that launches recurrently`
* then enter a description and as command enter the command you used to run the script before (`python script.py`)
* If you do not want to check if it works every hour go to `Advanced` and
* click `Edit` at the same height as `Minute`
* then click `Every minute` and confirm everything

Now wait some minutes and drink some water or tea or eat some fruits and vegetables . It's healthy :)

When you come back just run the same `cat` command you run before (`cat Documents/CronDemoLog/log.txt`) to see if it worked. It should look like this:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ cat Documents/CronDemoLog/log.txt
This script was executed at 14:7:0 on 2017-8-10
This script was executed at 14:8:8 on 2017-8-10
This script was executed at 14:19:1 on 2017-8-10
This script was executed at 14:20:1 on 2017-8-10
This script was executed at 14:21:1 on 2017-8-10
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ‚ñÆ
```

That in mind I think you saw that the cron scheduler is really simple and mighty. You can run any script you want at specific times and dates. This gives you a whole lot of opportunities.

## Example with an LCD display

...

# Bonus: Manage users/groups

If you want to add a new user, remove a user or great groups for user this is also fairly simple:

## Add a new user

To add a new user you really just need one command and to be the root user (`sudo`-rights):

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo adduser newusername
```

*Important note: The new user name can not contain caps like `newUserName`.*

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo adduser newusername
Adding user `newusername' ...
Adding new group `newusername' (1003) ...
Adding new user `newusername' (1002) with group `newusername' ...
Crating home directory `/home/newusername' ...
Copying files from `/etc/skel' ...
Enter new UNIX password: ‚ñÆ
```

Now enter two times a new password for the new account:

```
Retype new UNIX password: ‚ñÆ
```

And now you can add specific information about the user or just press ENTER for the default value:

```
passwd: password updated successfully
Changing the user information for the newusernam
Enter the new value, or press ENTER for the default
        Full Name []: New User Name‚ñÆ
```

```
        Room Number []: ‚ñÆ
```

```
        Work Phone []: ‚ñÆ
```

```
        Home Phone []: ‚ñÆ
```

If you are ready and everything is correct confirm by pressing `y` or deny by pressing `n` (and ENTER):

```
Is the information correct? [Y/n] ‚ñÆ
```

## Change the password of a user as sudo user

Probably you are not like me and forget the password of the new user after like ten seconds but hey, here you go:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo passwd newusername
Enter new UNIX password: ‚ñÆ
```

```
Retype new UNIX password: ‚ñÆ
```

```
passwd: password updated successfully
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ‚ñÆ
```

## Change permissions of users to files

With Linux groups you can simple manage many user at once.

For example you can set permissions for some folders for every guest account at the same time.

This works because of in Linux every user has a unique user ID (UID) and a group ID (GID).

Source: [yolinux](http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/LinuxTutorialManagingGroups.html)

Therefore, if you remember 6. > Commands > File system > `ls`,  the file system looks like this:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ls -l
total 36
drwxr-xr-x 2 pi pi 4096 Aug  1 14:59 Desktop
drwxr-xr-x 2 pi pi 4096 Aug  1 18:25 Documents
...
```

In which the first `pi` is the owner and the second one is the `group` where this file belongs to (remember that files stand in this case for directories `d` and *normal* files `-`, ...).

More important are the three octets (`rwx`, `r-x`, `r-x`) at the begin of each file in this view:

* The first octet are the permissions of the file owner > the first `pi`
* The second octet are the permissions of the group where the file belongs to > the second `pi`
* The last octet are the permissions for everyone else

You can with this very easy manage permissions to files for many users.

**How easy is it in real life?**

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ mkdir Documents/Example
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ cd Documents/Example
pi@raspberrypi:~/Documents/ExampleDir $ touch example_file
pi@raspberrypi:~/Documents/ExampleDir $ ls -l
total 0
-rw-r--r-- 1 pi pi 0 Aug 12 14:03 example_file
pi@raspberrypi:~/Documents/ExampleDir $ ‚ñÆ
```

Now we can use the command `chmod` with `u` (user) or `g` (group) or `o` (other) (or a combination of them) `+` or `-` and a combination of `r`, `w` and `x` (only one of every character).

For example I as an owner want to have the right to `r` - read, `w` write and `x` execute this file (I know this doesn't make so much sense - if it was a directory this would have more sense).

To get the rights one command is all I need:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~/Documents/ExampleDir $ chmod u+x example_file
pi@raspberrypi:~/Documents/ExampleDir $ ls -l
total 0
-rwxr--r-- 1 pi pi 0 Aug 12 14:03 example_file
pi@raspberrypi:~/Documents/ExampleDir $ ‚ñÆ
```

And because this is a secret file nobody should be able to read it besides me:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~/Documents/ExampleDir $ chmod go-r example_file
pi@raspberrypi:~/Documents/ExampleDir $ ls -l
total 0
-rwx------ 1 pi pi 0 Aug 12 14:03 example_file
pi@raspberrypi:~/Documents/ExampleDir $ ‚ñÆ
```

Now I recognized that my file isn't that secret and that even others should be able to read and edit it:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~/Documents/ExampleDir $ chmod go+rw example_file
pi@raspberrypi:~/Documents/ExampleDir $ ls -l
total 0
-rwxrw-rw- 1 pi pi 0 Aug 12 14:03 example_file
pi@raspberrypi:~/Documents/ExampleDir $ ‚ñÆ
```

See - very simple, even over the console.

## Add groups and add user to groups

Now we just need to know how we can add users to groups and heck even create them in the first place

### Add a group

Create a user group:

```
sudo addgroup <groupname>
```

Yay. That was it. Ready. Go on.

Example:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo addgroup newgroup
Adding group `newgroup' (GID 1004) ...
Done.
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ‚ñÆ
```

### Add user to a group

To add an user to a group isn't such difficult as you think once you read the manual page of `usermod`:

Just add the command options `-a` for append and `-G` for group and you're set:

```
sudo usermod -a -G <groupname> <username>
```

Example:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo usermod -a -G newgroup newusername
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ‚ñÆ
```

### View all the users in a group

Wit the following command you will get a list off all the users in a group:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ grep <groupname> /etc/group
```

That means for our example:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ grep newgroup /etc/group
newgroup:x:1004:newusername
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ‚ñÆ
```

---

Too view all groups on your system you can also use the command `getnet group`

With the command `grep` (**g**lobally search a **r**egular **e**xpression and **p**rint - [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep)) you can search this list and output only the lines where the following string is contained.

Through this you can use also the command `getent group | grep <groupname>` to get all users of a group:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ getent group | grep newgroup
newgroup:x:1004:newusername
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ‚ñÆ
```

---

## Remove user and groups

Ok, now I have 20 users and 5 groups, but I think I can delete some of them:

### Remove a user

(Source: [cyberciti](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-remove-user-command/))

Very simple: `userdel` + `-r` +  `<username>`

This will not only remove the user but also delete it's local home directory (`-r`).

So let's delete our user `newusername`:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo userdel -r newusername
userdel: newusername mail spool (/var/mail/newusername) not found
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ grep newgroup /etc/group
newgroup:x:1004:
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ‚ñÆ
```

#### Lock the account before you finally delete it

If you don't want to delete the account, only lock them (for some time or as a test if the account is still be used) use these commands.

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo passwd -l <username>
```

Instead of instantly locking the account you can set a specific time when the account will be locked: 

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo usermod --expiredate 1 <username>
```

(Number in this format: `YYYY-MM-DD`)

If an account is locked the user will get a message at login that the account expired and he should search for the admin.

### Remove a group

Probably this is no surprise but the command to remove groups is `delgroup`:

So now we have an empty example group.
Let's remove it too:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo groupdel -r newgroup
Removing group `newgroup' ...
Done.
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ grep newgroup /etc/group
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ‚ñÆ
```

So you now can also manage users on any Linux system via command line. Nice.
